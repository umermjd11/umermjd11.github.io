# About Me

I am an ML engineer and Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science & Engineering with a robust foundation in machine learning and AI systems. With over seven years of academic experience, I have a proven track record in implementing machine learning and deep learning algorithms. My expertise lies in Python and C++, complemented by proficiency in ML frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn. Additionally, I possess a deep understanding of object-oriented programming, which enables me to design efficient and scalable software solutions.

Throughout my academic journey, I have published several papers in international journals and conferences, focusing on decentralized learning and federated systems. This research has honed my technical skills and deepened my understanding of complex machine learning frameworks. Collaboration has been a key aspect of my experience, as I have actively engaged with co-authors and supervisors to discuss model designs and conduct peer programming, fostering a dynamic and innovative environment.

I am eager to excel in collaborative professional environments, working closely with multidisciplinary teams of domain experts, data scientists, and engineers to tailor solutions that meet both client and organizational needs. Driven by a passion for innovation, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Afiniti's mission of enhancing customer experiences through advanced AI technologies.
